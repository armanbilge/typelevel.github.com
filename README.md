typelevel website
=================

This is the website of typelevel.scala. It is built on Jekyll and served at [typelevel.org](https://typelevel.org).

## Getting Started (the short version)

If you just want to add a blog post or fix a typo in the content, here's how to get started.

### Creating a blog post

1. Create a new file in the [`./collections/_posts`](./collections/_posts/) directory or copy an existing post. Its name should have the format `YYYY-MM-DD-short_title.md`.
2. Set the `title` (short title of the post, appears as the HTML `<title>`) and `author` (your GitHub user name) in the front matter. MathJax is available via `mathjax: true` inside the front matter.
3. If this is your first blog post, please indicate if you want your name and a profile picture to appear on the post. If not, you can remove the `author` field from the front matter. Add your details in `_data/authors.yml`.
4. Write your content using Markdown. For code highlighting, use the usual GitHub syntax:

```scala
def yourCode: Here
```

If you haven't written a post before, please add yourself to `_data/authors.yml`.

That's it, we'll take care of the rest. If you wish, you can also submit just a plain Markdown file and we'll be happy to integrate it.

### Previewing your changes

#### Bundler

To preview your changes, you have to install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) first.
To download and set up all necessary dependencies, run

```console
$ bundle install
... lots of text ...
Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 81 gems now installed.
Bundled gems are installed into `./vendor/bundle`
```

Then, you can generate the site by running

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll serve -wl --baseurl ''
```

The generated site will end up in the `_site` directory.

#### Nix

A fully configured Jekyll is available as a Nix app.  Assumes that you have [installed Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [enabled flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Installing_flakes).

```console
$ nix run github:typelevel/typelevel.github.com#jekyll build

      Generating...
                    done in 3.635 seconds.

```

There is also a devshell for direct invocation, and a convenient alias:

```console
$ nix develop github:typelevel/typelevel.github.com
ðŸ”¨ Welcome to typelevel-org-shell

## Development

### CSS

The stylesheets are written in SASS, and can be found in the `css` and `_sass` directories.
It is being processed/compiled into regular CSS by Jekyll.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.scss # Custom CSS, brings all stylesheets together
â”œâ”€â”€ _sass/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
```

### Javascript

Javascript can be found in the `js/` folder, which also includes its dependencies.

### Templates

All templates/layouts can be found in the `_layouts` folder, except the blog layout, which is located inside its own subfolder `blog/`.

### Images

Images for styling purposes are located inside `img/`, photos inside `img/media/`.

### Adding a project

There are three types of projects: organization projects, affiliate projects, and core/featured projects.

To add an organization project, insert a new entry, alphabetically, in the `_data/projects.yml` file with the following keys:

```yml
- title: "Cats"
  description: "A library intended to provide abstractions for functional programming in Scala, leveraging its unique features. Design goals are approachability, modularity, documentation and efficiency."
  github: "https://github.com/typelevel/cats"
  platforms: [js, jvm, native]
  permalink: "https://typelevel.org/cats/" # optional
```

Right now nothing more than the correct front matter is required.

To add
- an **affiliate** project, add `affiliate: true` to the project entry
- a **core** project, add `core: true` to the project entry

### Adding a page

To add a page, 

1. Create a directory in the root of the project, with at least an `index.html` file in that directory. 
2. Update  `_data/nav.yml` to add it to the navigation. (The site navigation is not fully dynamic for simplification.)

Sample front matter for a page:

```yml
layout: page
title: "Code of Conduct"
```

### Help, CI is failing on a Dependabot PR

We need to update the gemset as well.

```sh
nix run nixpkgs#bundix
git commit -am "Update gemset"
```
